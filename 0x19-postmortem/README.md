*Postmortem: When load balancers dance tango and servers sing blues*

*Issue Summary*:

Duration:
	Start Time: 2024-01-17 14:30
	End Time: 2024-01-17 16:45

Impact:
	The web application decided to play hide-and-seek, leaving users reporting slow response times and service unavailability.
	Approximately 30% of users were affected during the peak hours.

Root Cause:
	A misconfiguration in the load balancer settings led to an increased load on the backend servers, causing a bottleneck in processing incoming requests.



*Timeline*:

14:30 UTC: Issue Detected
	Monitoring alerts indicated a spike in latency and server errors.

14:35 UTC: Initial Investigation
	The operations team started investigating logs and metrics to identify the source of the performance degradation.

14:50 UTC: Misleading Path
	Initially, the focus was on the database servers due to a recent schema update. However, no anomalies were found in the database performance.

15:05 UTC: Escalation
	As the issue persisted, the incident was escalated to the DevOps team to assess the entire web stack.

15:20 UTC: Load Balancer Configuration Check
	DevOps engineers discovered an abnormal spike in traffic to one of the backend servers. Further investigation revealed a misconfiguration in the load balancer, causing uneven distribution of requests.

15:45 UTC: Root Cause Identified
	The misconfigured load balancer was causing a disproportionate number of requests to hit a specific backend server, leading to increased response times and intermittent outages.

16:00 UTC: Issue Resolution
	The load balancer configuration was corrected to evenly distribute traffic among backend servers, immediately alleviating the performance issues.

16:15 UTC: Verification
	The team monitored the system for any residual effects and confirmed that the web application was operating smoothly.



*Root Cause and Resolution*:

Root Cause:
	Misconfiguration in the load balancer settings led to an uneven distribution of traffic, causing performance degradation in one of the backend servers.

Resolution:
	The load balancer configuration was adjusted to evenly distribute incoming requests among backend servers, resolving the bottleneck and restoring normal system performance.



*Corrective and Preventative Measures*:

Improvements/Fixes:
	Conduct a thorough review of load balancer configurations regularly to identify and rectify any anomalies.
	Implement automated monitoring of load balancer metrics to detect and alert on unusual traffic patterns.

Tasks:
	Develop and implement a checklist for load balancer configurations to prevent similar misconfigurations in the future.
	Enhance documentation on load balancer best practices for the operations team.
	Conduct a post-incident review meeting to discuss the lessons learned and improve incident response procedures.
